# LangChain
## Key Features

-   **Modular Design**: Easily swap out different LLMs, vector stores, or prompt templates.
-   **[Feature 1]**: e.g., **Document Loading**: Ingests data from various sources like PDFs, TXT, or web pages.
-   **[Feature 2]**: e.g., **Vector Embeddings**: Converts text data into numerical representations for semantic search.
-   **[Feature 3]**: e.g., **Conversational Memory**: Remembers previous parts of the conversation to provide context-aware responses.
-   **[Feature 4]**: e.g., **Custom Prompts**: Uses engineered prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and response format.

## How It Works

This application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

1.  **Data Ingestion**: Documents or data are loaded from a source directory.
2.  **Indexing**: The data is split into smaller chunks, converted into vector embeddings using a sentence-transformer model, and stored in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma).
3.  **User Query**: The user asks a question.
4.  **Retrieval**: The user's query is also converted into an embedding, and the vector database is searched for the most semantically similar text chunks.
5.  **Generation**: The original query and the retrieved text chunks are passed to an LLM within a carefully crafted prompt.
6.  **Response**: The LLM uses the provided context to generate a relevant and accurate answer.

*(Note: Adjust this section if your project does not use RAG architecture.)*

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   An API key from an LLM provider (e.g., [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
```

**2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

This is a best practice to keep project dependencies isolated.

  - **Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

  - **macOS / Linux:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

**3. Install the required packages:**

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary Python libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure your API Key:**

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. This file will securely store your secret API key. Add the following line to it:

```env
# Example for Google Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Example for OpenAI
# OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

*Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key. The `.gitignore` file is already configured to prevent this file from being committed.*

## Usage

To run the main application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

*(Replace `main.py` with the name of your main script if it's different.)*
